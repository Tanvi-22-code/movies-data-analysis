🎬 Movies Data Analysis Project

📌 Overview
This project performs an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a movie dataset to identify patterns and trends related to movie genres, popularity, audience ratings, and release years. The objective is to understand what factors influence a movie’s popularity and rating using real-world data.
This project is created for learning, practice, and resume-building purposes and demonstrates core data analysis skills using Python.

🔄 Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering


•	Converted release dates into year format

•	Handled missing values and corrected data types

•	Removed unnecessary columns

•	Created rating categories based on statistical percentiles:
   1.	Not Popular
   2.	Below Average
   3.	Average
   4.	Popular
   5.	Split and exploded the genre column to analyze each genre individually
